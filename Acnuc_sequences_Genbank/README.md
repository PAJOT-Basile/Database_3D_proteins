This is a storage folder. It contains the data extracted from the Acnuc database.

To be used correctly, you should save the files in this folder with a name similar to this one: 
> "Families_TAXONOMYLEVEL_Sequences.gb" 

>> with TAXONOMYLEVEL being the name of a taxonomy level (super-kingdom, kingdom, class, order, family, genus, species, variety).

These files must be saved with Acnuc aquisition methods with the Genbank format.
