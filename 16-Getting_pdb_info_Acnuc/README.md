# 16-Getting_pdb_info_Acnuc

The `.dat` files are extracted from acnuc using the same method as in step 01 to get the gene sequence families.
They contain all the Genbank format sequences from every gene family in the considered Super-Kingdom. Here, we want to extract the PDB information for each sequence that we have in the database.
