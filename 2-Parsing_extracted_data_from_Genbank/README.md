This folder contains the python script to transform the ACNUC files in the Acnuc_sequences_Genbank folder.

This script takes the ACNUC files and creates a table containing the IDs, taxonomy, sequence and 3D folding data extracted from the ACNUC database.

The only two conditions for this to work are to:
  1. Have the files extracted from ACNUC under the Genbank format (".gb" files)
  2. Have these data files located in the beforementionned storage folder (*Acnuc_sequences_Genbank*)
